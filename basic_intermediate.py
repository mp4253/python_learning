# Beginner to Intermediate (Nested and Multiple Conditions)

# Input a year and check if it’s a leap year (divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400).





# Compare Three Numbers
# Input three numbers and print the largest one.

# Grading System
# Based on marks:

# 90–100 → A

# 75–89 → B

# 60–74 → C

# 35–59 → D

# <35 → Fail

# Check Uppercase or Lowercase

# Simple Calculator

# Number Guessing Game
# Let user input a number. If it's equal to a predefined secret number, print "Correct!", else "Try Again".
